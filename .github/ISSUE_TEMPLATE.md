<!-- Disclaimer  -->
<!-- Moonlight is built on top of the default Firefox theme. In order to avoid breaking changes, customisation is kept to a minimum and to the core. As such, extensions are not supported out of the box but if you'd like to customize your favorite extension feel free to drop a file into the custom folder and submit a PR. Thank you for your understanding. -->
